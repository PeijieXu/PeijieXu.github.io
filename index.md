## Hi There ~

I graduated from Chongqing University (CQU), where I got a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. I am currently working in the Institute of Smart Engineering, CQU.
  
My research focous on robot's motion planning and grasping. 
  
You can find my [CV](https://github.com/PeijieXu/PeijieXu.github.io/edit/main/index.md) here.
  

## Research Projects

### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - Guided Offshore Wind Farm Voltage Control
_Undergraduate Thesis Project_  
_Supervisor: Prof. Hui Li_  
_Lab: [State Key Laboratory of PES](sklpe.cqu.edu.cn)_
  
* Applied DRL to minimize the Average Voltage Deviation (AVD) of the offshore wind farm; the work was awarded the outstanding undergraduate thesis of CQU (**top 1.5%** in the university)
* Built reactive power-voltage optimization model and formulated it as a Markov Decision Process; established the agents’ actor & critic’s Deep Neural Network and the interactive environment of RL; trained the agents with adapted Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Multi-Agent DDPG 
* Decreased AVD by 11.48% after adding the forward difference of active power into observation; decreased AVD to 5.4×10-4 p.u. and 3.6×10-4 p.u. using policy trained by DDPG and Multi-Agent DDPG respectively, which means the proposed multi-agent-based method improves the control performance by 33.33%
