# Hi There ~

I graduated from Chongqing University (CQU), where I got a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. I am currently working in the Institute of Smart Engineering, CQU.
  
My research focous on robot's motion planning and grasping. 
  
You can find my **[CV](_posts/2021-8-24-project-1.md)** here.
  

# Research Projects

### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - Guided Offshore Wind Farm Voltage Control 
_Undergraduate Thesis Project_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Hui Li_  
_Lab: [State Key Laboratory of PES](http://sklpe.cqu.edu.cn/)_  

* Applied DRL to minimize the Average Voltage Deviation (AVD) of the offshore wind farm; the work was awarded the outstanding undergraduate thesis of CQU (**top 1.5%** in the university)
* Decreased AVD to 5.4×10^-4 p.u. and 3.6×10^-4 p.u. using policy trained by DDPG-based and Multi-Agent DDPG-based method respectively, which means the proposed multi-agent-based method improves the control performance by 33.33%

### Wind Farm Multi-Agent Consensus Control
_Research Assistant_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Minyou Chen_  

* Designed and simulated a distributed consensus algorithm to control output power regulation of 10 doubly-fed induction generators-based wind turbines with on-site battery energy storage systems

### Electrical Compensation Technology for Visible Light Communication (VLC)
_Leader_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Prof. Quanming, Luo_  

* Investigated into the compensation technology for the electrical index deterioration of VLC; extended communication distance of VLC system whose LED worked as a scattering light source by 200%
