# Hi There ~

I graduated from Chongqing University (CQU), where I got a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. I am currently working in the Institute of Smart Engineering, CQU.
  
My research focous on robot's motion planning and grasping. 
  
You can find my [CV](https://github.com/PeijieXu/PeijieXu.github.io/edit/main/index.md) here.
  

# Research Projects

### Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - Guided Offshore Wind Farm Voltage Control
_Undergraduate Thesis Project_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Hui Li_  
_Lab: [State Key Laboratory of PES](http://sklpe.cqu.edu.cn/)_
  
* Applied DRL to minimize the Average Voltage Deviation (AVD) of the offshore wind farm; the work was awarded the outstanding undergraduate thesis of CQU (**top 1.5%** in the university)
* Decreased AVD to 5.4×10^-4 p.u. and 3.6×10^-4 p.u. using policy trained by DDPG-based and Multi-Agent DDPG-based method respectively, which means the proposed multi-agent-based method improves the control performance by 33.33%
