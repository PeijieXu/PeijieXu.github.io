# Hi There ~

I graduated from Chongqing University (CQU), where I got a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. I am currently working in the Institute of Smart Engineering, CQU.
  
My research focuses on robot's motion planning and grasping.

# Research Projects

<font size=5> <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - Guided Offshore Wind Farm Voltage Control</b> </font>  
_Undergraduate Thesis Project_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Hui Li_  
_Lab: State Key Laboratory of [PES](http://sklpe.cqu.edu.cn/)_  

* Applied Multi-Agent DRL to minimize the Average Voltage Deviation (AVD) of the offshore wind farm; the work was awarded the outstanding undergraduate thesis of CQU (**top 1.5%** in the university)
* **[Detail ...](Projects_Details/1_underguaduate_thesis.md)**

<font size=5> <b>Wind Farm Multi-Agent Consensus Control</b> </font>  
_Research Assistant_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Minyou Chen_  

* Investigated control methods for a distributed wind farm system; designed and simulated a distributed consensus algorithm to regulate output power of wind turbines

<font size=5> <b>Electrical Compensation Technology for Visible Light Communication (VLC)</b></font>  
_Leader_ | _Supervisor: Prof. Prof. Quanming, Luo_  

* Investigated into the compensation technology for the electrical index deterioration of VLC
