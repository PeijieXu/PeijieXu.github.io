# Hi There ~

I graduated from Chongqing University (CQU), where I got a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering. I currently work in the Institute of Smart Engineering, CQU.
  
My research focuses on robot's motion planning and grasping.

# Research Projects

<font size=4> <b>Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - Guided Offshore Wind Farm Voltage Control</b> </font>  

* Applied Multi-Agent DRL to minimize the Average Voltage Deviation of the offshore wind farm
* The work was awarded the outstanding undergraduate thesis of CQU (top 1.5 % in the university)
* [Detail ...](Projects_Details/1_underguaduate_thesis.md)
  
<font size=4> <b>Wind Farm Multi-Agent Consensus Control</b> </font>  

* Investigated control methods for a distributed wind farm system; designed a distributed consensus algorithm to regulate output power of wind turbines
  
<font size=4> <b>Electrical Compensation Technology for Visible Light Communication (VLC)</b></font>  

* Investigated into the compensation technology for the electrical index deterioration of VLC
